# Flutter Widgets Playground

This project is a **personal exploration of Flutter's widget catalog**.  
The goal is to **experiment with different widgets, understand their properties, and see how they behave in real scenarios** through live, interactive examples.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Idea
- Explore **basic and advanced widgets** in Flutter beyond conventional usage.  
- Create **practical examples for each widget** to understand its effect, properties, and best usage patterns.  
- Make it easier for **hands-on learning** for both beginners and advanced Flutter developers.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.  
2. Open the project in **Android Studio or VSCode**.  
3. Run any Dart file example via `main.dart` or integrate it into a page.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
- Each widget example is in a **separate Dart file** for easy reuse.  
- Some examples use **StatefulWidget** to demonstrate interaction or animations.  
- Feel free to modify or combine examples to explore different widget behaviors.
